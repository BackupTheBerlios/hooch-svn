- Fix Makefile, so that ``make clean'' is not required, every time.
- Add parser features:
	* Drop notion of single/multiple stms (instead, what we need is
		another datatype that may be listed on the right side of the
		assignment, namely a set (comma-separated atomic fields)).
	* Allow declaration of the members = { id1:*, id2:work, id3 };
		statement.
- Error detection:
	* Build in error detection mechanism with nice errors.  An example:
		
		contact { name = "Something"; }
	
	  This now simply gives a "syntax error", but does not say why.  A
	  message like "expecting contact name after keyword `contact'" is no
	  superfluous luxery.
